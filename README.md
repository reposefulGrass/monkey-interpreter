# Monkey Interpreter

An interpreter for the monkey language written in C.

The Monkey programming language is a fictional language that is 
used in the book `Writing An Interpreter in Go`.

I use several personal auxillary libraries:
* linked_list - To construct a list of statements.
* dynamic_string - For creating strings that can grow easily.

# Why

I am a masochist. Most other implementations are done in languages
where you do not have to manage the memory. I also wanted to compare
how languages are written in C versus Rust; although note that
I am not the best at C programming; this project will have many flaws
(please tell me if you find any!).

# Progress

Currently I am almost done with the parser (page 89 in the book).
